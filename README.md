Confession: I borrowed/modified a lot of the code from: https://michaljanaszek.com/blog/test-website-performance-with-puppeteer/

Usage:

```sh
node index.js <url> <number of trials>
```

`node index.js https://github.com/kyle-west 10` will test 10 speed trials of loading github.com on Chrome and firefox
